If the dealer has any high aces (counted as 11) as part of his total, he must hit while his count is below 18.
If any player has a value greater than their current value, the dealer must continue to hit. E.g. if a player has 20, the dealer must hit until they have 20 or greater.
If the player and dealer end up with the same value, the player loses the hand. so if both have 21 dealer wins
if multiple players beat the dealer, all players that beat dealer gets 1 point
wins can if no player gets to 20, highest score wins
A player or dealer win with two cards that total 21 is worth 2 points
A player and dealer each with two cards that total 21 are both awarded 1 point
otherwise 1 point
